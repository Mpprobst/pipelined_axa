\f0\fs24 \cf0 Stage 4 of the pipeline will handle ALU operations and writing to the register file. This stage will perform its function when once stage 3 has completed its most recent operation, which is controlled using ir3. An opcode is retrieved from ir3 which determines what instruction needs to be executed. If an instruction is a branch or jump, the branch or jump flag is set so that stage 1 can be prompted to handle it. All instructions that write to a register load the result of their computation into the res register. If there are no WAW dependencies at the end of computation, the destination register will be set to the value of res, otherwise, it will wait until there are no data dependencies.}
